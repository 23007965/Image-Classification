# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Image Classification

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for image classification and to verify the response for new images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains handwritten digit images (0-9), and the model aims to classify them correctly. The challenge is to achieve high accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

## Neural Network Model

Include the neural network model diagram.
